# JavaOOP-exercises

This repository contains Java programs developed as part of coursework for the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) class. Each project focuses on different aspects of OOP and demonstrates various concepts learned during the course.

## Projects Included

### Age Calculator

A Java program to calculate a person's age either based on a decimal age or a specific birthdate. It utilizes `java.time.LocalDate` and `java.time.Period` for date calculations.

### Casino

A simulation of a simple casino game using classes `Dice` and `Roulette`. It demonstrates basic object instantiation and method invocation in Java.

### Date Formatter

A Java class `Date` that formats and displays dates in a specified format (`MM/DD/YYYY`). It illustrates basic Java class construction and method usage.

### Password Generator

A Java class `Password` that generates random passwords of a specified length and checks if they meet criteria for password strength (uppercase, lowercase, numbers). It showcases random number generation and string manipulation.

### Payment Message Generator

A Java class `Payment` that generates formatted payment messages including details like recipient name, amount, description, and date. It demonstrates string concatenation and formatting.

### Social Media Post

A Java class `Post` representing a social media post with features like ID, message, likes, and comments. It shows how to use arrays/lists and perform basic operations like adding likes and comments.

## Usage

Each project includes a `main` method for demonstration purposes. You can run them individually to see the output or integrate them into larger applications as needed.

## Setup

To compile and run these Java programs, make sure you have a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. You can compile each `.java` file using `javac` and run the compiled `.class` files using `java`.

Example:
```bash
javac Age.java
java Age
